# Codeforces-golang
Solutions to challenges found at [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), solved with Go and sorted by rating.

## Motivation
The best way to learn a language, spoken or otherwise, is to use it. To this end, this repo is a demonstration of my learning process applied to Go.

It goes without saying that a language with more in-built structures and algorithms like C++ or Python is more suitable for competition, but I find this a useful exercise in learning the ins and outs of a language in extremely isolated contexts. I find this isolation is conducive to incremental learning (and fun).

## Disclaimer
This code will likely not be pretty or idiomatic, but those qualities aren't priorities here. My single goal with this project is to become more comfortable with the standard library and syntax of the language, not to produce top quality, maintanable code. I am completing these challenges as I would during a contest; quickly and efficiently.
