Solutions to challenges found at [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), solved with Go and sorted by rating.

## Motivation
The best way to learn a language, spoken or otherwise, is to use it. To this end, this repo is a demonstration of my learning process applied to Go.

It goes without saying that a language with more in-built structures and algorithms like C++ or Python is more suitable for competition, but I find this a useful exercise in learning the ins and outs of a language in extremely isolated contexts. I find this isolation is conducive to incremental learning (and fun).
